		<div id="features_grid">
		<div class="feature">
		<!--<img src="images/ring_signatures.png" alt="Ring Signatures"> -->
			<h4>Ring Signatures</h4>
			<p>Each private transaction appears to be signed by one user out of a randomly selected group of users, whereby there is no possibility to determine who exactly provided the signature.</p>
		</div>

		<div class="feature">
		<!--<img src="images/stealth_addresses.png" alt="Stealth Addresses"> -->
			<h4>Stealth Addresses</h4>
			<p>Creates random one-time addresses for every transaction on behalf of the recipient. By using stealth addresses, the unlinkability of transactions is guaranteed.</p>
		</div>

		<div class="feature">
		<!-- <img src="images/dual_coin.png" alt="Dual Coin System"> -->
			<h4>Dual Coin System</h4>
			<p>XSPEC (public and transparent) and SPECTRE (private and untraceable) are easily swapped at anytime, offering either accountability or anonymity as needed. Both coins can be staked for rewards.</p>
		</div>

		<div class="feature">
		<!-- <img src="images/stealth_staking.png" alt="Stealth Staking"> -->
			<h4>Stealth Staking</h4>
			<p>Proof-of-Anonymous-Stake, a unique consensus algorithm, uses ring signatures to allow for anonymous staking rewards with no public record of your balance and no ability to link a user to staking transactions.</p>
		</div>

		<div class="feature">
		<!-- <img src="images/proof_of_stake_v3.png" alt="Proof-of-Stake V3"> -->
			<h4>Proof-of-Stake V3</h4>
			<p>A blockchain consensus model where the creator of the next block is chosen via various combinations of random selection, wealth, and coin age, making transactions approval fast and a network more scalable.</p>
		</div>

		<div class="feature">
		<!-- <img src="images/tor_obfs4.png" alt="Tor + obfs4"> -->
			<h4>Tor + obfs4</h4>
			<p>Spectrecoin runs as a Tor hidden service, protecting your IP address by routing traffic through several hops on the Tor network. OBFS4 disguises Tor usage as normal internet traffic, helping users in Tor blocked countries.</p>
		</div>

		<div class="feature">
		<!-- <img src="images/declining_inflation.png" alt="Declining Inflation"> -->
			<h4>Declining Inflation</h4>
			<p>Since XSPEC and SPECTRE offer different fixed staking rewards, the inflation rate will vary depending on the ratio of XSPEC to SPECTRE staking on the network, but will lower over time.</p>

<h3 id="buy_Spectrecoin">How to Buy Spectrecoins</h3>
		<div>
		<p>You can buy Spectrecoins on various <a href="#exchanges">exchanges</a>. Currently the exchange with the highest Spectrecoin (XSPEC) volume is <a href="https://www.livecoin.net/en/trading/XSPEC_BTC" target="_blank">Livecoin</a>.</p>

		<ol>
		<li>You need to access the chosen exchange's offical website and register there. Take precaution to avoid <a href="https://www.finder.com/bitcoin-scams" target="_blank">phishing scams.</a></li>

		<li>When you enter the exchange's front page after registration, use the search function to find XSPEC among the listed coins and choose a suitable trading pair, i.e. XSPEC/BTC (traded for Bitcoins) XSPEC/LTC (traded for Litecoins).</li>

		<li>After choosing a trading pair for Spectrecoin you will need to transfer chosen trading pair coins (LTC or BTC) to your account. Find the 'Deposit' option in the Wallets, Account, Portfolio, or Profile section, depending on the exchange.</li>

		<li>Take BTC for example as your coin to trade for Spectrecoin (XSPEC). You select BTC among the list of coins and tokens and the exchange will generate for you an address (wallet) to transfer your trading coins from your own wallet address or exchange account that you already control.</li>

		<li>Once you have deposited funds in your wallet, go back to the 'Markets' or 'Exchange' section to find XSPEC and choose the suitable proposition among ‘Sell Orders’ prices as well as amount you want to buy.</li>

		<li>After you have agreed to a certain price and amount you press ‘Buy XSPEC’ and wait for the trading operation to complete. If you offer a bid below the current price, you will have to wait to see if your order gets filled. If you choose a price from the 'Sell' or 'Asks' orders, that XSPEC would appear in your ‘Balances’ immediately.</li>

		<li>After that it is highly recommended to transfer your new coins off the exchange to your <a href="#downloads">Spectrecoin Wallet </a> to secure them and receive additional <a href="#staking_Spectrecoin">XSPEC staking rewards</a>.</li>

<h3 id="transact_anonymously">How to Transact Anonymously with Spectrecoin</h3>
		<div>
		<h5>4 Types of Transactions</h5>
		<p>The Spectrecoin software allows 4 different types of transactions and it is important to understand the difference between those. We need to remind you that the network has two coins, ‘normal‘ XSPEC, much like Bitcoin and associated with ‘normal‘ UTXOs and where transactions can be linked to each other. Then we have the anonymous SPECTRE, a different type of coin that can only be spent using ring signatures and where transactions cannot be linked and where the sender / receiver cannot be determined.</p>

		<p><strong>XSPEC > XSPEC</strong> : These are ‘normal‘ transactions, much like Bitcoin, where the transaction is visible on the blockchain and can be traced from sender to receiver by the public keys but not to your real life identify or IP address.</p>

		<p><strong>XSPEC > SPECTRE</strong> : These transactions create anonymous SPECTRE coins that can subsequently be used for anonymous transactions. The balance of SPECTRE coins will show in your ‘PRIVATE’ balance.</p>

		<p><strong>SPECTRE > SPECTRE</strong> : These are fully anonymous transactions using ring signatures and these transactions send SPECTRE from a ‘PRIVATE’ balance to another ‘PRIVATE’ balance using a stealth address only. The ring size for all transactions is set at 10, ensuring strong privacy.</p>

		<p><strong>SPECTRE > XSPEC</strong> : These transactions generate XSPEC from SPECTRE and spends anonymous outputs to generate new coins. These newly generated XSPEC have no transaction history.</p>

		<h5>How to Conduct an Anonymous Transaction</h5>
		<p>As mentioned above, an anonymous transaction is created when you send an amount of SPECTRE from your ‘PRIVATE’ balance to another ‘PRIVATE’ balance using a Stealth Address. In these types of transactions anonymous coins are sent using ring signatures and there is no way to link the sender to the receiver or what exact amount is being sent (in most cases).</p>

		<p>Firstly, go to the ‘Send‘ tab and select ‘PRIVATE‘ as the source of your funds. If you don’t have any coins in your private balance then use the ‘BALANCE TRANSFER‘ tab to transfer some coins into your private balance.</p>


		<p>Next, enter the receiver's stealth address and the amount to send. Click 'Send Payment' and enter your passphrase when asked to confirm. Another dialog window will ask you to confirm the fee and payment. Confirm the transaction.</p>

		<p>Here you can see the transaction on the <a href="https://chainz.cryptoid.info/xspec/" target="_blank">Spectrecoin Blockchain Explorer</a>.</p>

		<p>Stealth addresses protect the recipient’s privacy, and Ring Signatures protect the sender’s privacy.</p>

<h3>How to Secure Your Funds</h3>
		<div>
		<p>To avoid losing your funds, the general rules for dealing with cryptocurrencies apply. The most important of them being:</p>
	<ol><li>Do not store large amounts of money on exchanges, but in your local wallet.</li>
		<li>Encrypt your wallet, either by encrypting the wallet file itself, or by storing it in an encrypted container of some sort.</li>
		<li>Do not forget your encryption password!</li>
		<li>Back up your encrypted wallet to multiple places (see <a href="#wallet_backup">How to back up your wallet</a>).</li>
		<li>Keep your system secure. Use a dedicated system for running your cryptocurrency wallets if possible.</li></ol>

		<p>To encrypt your wallet using the inbuilt functionality, go to "Wallet Encryption" -> "Encrypt Wallet" and type in your password.</p>
		</div>

<h3 id="wallet_backup">How to Back Up Your Wallet</h3>
		<div>
		<p>You should back up your wallet to multiple places, to avoid accidental loss.</p>

		<p>Go to "Tools" -> "Backup Wallet" to back up your wallet.</p>

		<p>The .dat file that you are getting contains your address book, change addresses and all the corresponding private keys in a BerkeleyDB database format.</p>

		<p>It is a good practice to add the date of your backup to the file name, e.g. "Spectrecoin-2019-06-01.dat". If you have encrypted your wallet before, the backup will be encrypted as well.</p>
		</div>

<h3>How to Restore Your Wallet</h3>
		<div>
		<p>First, close the Spectrecoin program.<br>To restore your wallet backup, you must put the backed up .dat file inside the Spectrecoin "data directory".</p>

		<p>The location of this data directory for the different operating systems is:</p>

		<p>* Windows: C:\Users\Username\AppData\Roaming\Spectrecoin</p>

		<p>* Linux: ~/.spectrecoin</p>

		<p>* Mac OS: ~/Library/Application Support/Spectrecoin</p>

		<p>You must rename your backup to "wallet.dat" and place it inside this directory.<br>If there is an existing "wallet.dat" file, rename that file first, e.g. to "wallet-old.dat".<br>After you have installed your wallet.dat file here, start the program. You should now see your addresses and funds.</p>
